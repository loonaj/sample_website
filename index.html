    <h1> Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magicical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

    <p>HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"> Tim Berners</a>. It's not true that Sir TIm invented HTML in order to share pictures
    of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        <h3>Micheal Hartl</h3>
        <p>
            Micheal is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on the Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="htpps://www.learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="htpps://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
            plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillian are <em>slightly</em> exaggerated.

        <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
        <p>
            When he's not litterally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can fin Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough Tutorials.

        <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
